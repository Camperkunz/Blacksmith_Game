# Blacksmith game
It is a simple text-based game, played entirely in the console (f12)

### **Project context:**

This was originally a basic assignment from the start of the semester to practice using functions in JavaScript  
Even though the task was simple, I really liked the idea and decided to expand it  
I used the main concept and added more logic and features to make it more fun and interesting  

## Instructions
You are a young blacksmith  
Your goal is to earn 100 coins to build your first savings :)  
To do this, youâ€™ll need to chop trees, hunt, go mining, smelt ingots, craft weapons, and sell them!  
Good luck!

Use the following commands to interact with the game:

- `help()`
- `inventory()`
